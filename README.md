The project features a image stitching program that takes two images and stitches them horizontally. This project was done as a way to experiement with a variety of computer vision concepts and as a way to learn OpenCV.

## How to run
To use this program, download the files and run main.py. Place the two images that you would like to use in the project folder. Next in main.py, pass the two filenames into the stitch() call. Two example images are provided so that you can see the result upon downloading. Feel free to try your own images!
